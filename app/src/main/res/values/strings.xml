        "CAFÉ SATURNUS"
        "People go to Saturnus to drink large bowls of hot latte with the legendary cinnamon rolls – they are the biggest, and they’ve been described in the press as the best in town.
        A café and lunch spot with inspiration from France, where the decor has warm colors, a stone's throw from Stureplan and close to cultural attractions such as the Zita movie theater and the National Library of Sweden.
